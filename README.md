# Hangman Game

To check similarity between text documents using cosine similarity, first convert the raw text data into numerical vectors. This is typically done using methods like Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) or 
word embeddings. Each document is represented as a vector in a high-dimensional space. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between these vectors. A smaller angle (or higher cosine value) indicates greater 
similarity between the documents. This approach effectively quantifies how closely related the content of the documents is by comparing the orientation of their vector representations.
